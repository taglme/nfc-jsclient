## Reference Documentation

This SDK is intended to use in conjunction with Taglme Desktop REST API server. It is a thin API wrapper.
The main goal of the SDK is to handle requests complexity by hiding unnecessary details.

* [REST API specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Qwelp/nfcd/0.5) - this is full REST API specification in Swagger (OpenAPI) format. 

### Overview of SDK

SDK consist of several folders

* client - core classes with services. Services are used for communication with server API.
* models - basic types and structs 
* helpers - utils and helpers for various operations
* api - base Api class

Overview of API resources

* Adapter - represents a NFC reader. 
* Tag - represents NFC tag. 
* Job - represents a set of operations (steps) that should be performed with tag (read, write, format etc). 
Jobs are added to adapter queue and start execution as soon as tag discovered by adapter.
* JobRun  - represents the result of job execution.
* Event - represents the event generated by the server. 
Events are sent by server through web socket connection. Client should listen for event messages in order to be notified when job execution if finished.
